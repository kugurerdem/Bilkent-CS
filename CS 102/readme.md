# Course Description

This course was a continuation course for CS101 where we put into practice what we have learned in CS101.

# What I have learned?

We developed a more comprehensive understanding of what OOP is and the concepts of it such as: Inheritance & Interfaces, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, Interfaces.
We learned a bit of Java SWING library for GUI purposes and we also briefly looke through topics like: Recursion, Sorting and Searching algorithms, Exception handling and some of the fundamental data structures. We also made a project called [Droneer](https://github.com/kugurerdem/Droneer) where we had to use OOP and git as a group.
