# What is this course?

Continuation of CS 201, which is about basic abstract data types and some sorting algorithms that utilize recursion.

# What I have learned this course?

- Rewised run-time complexity analysis and recursion
- I have learned and implemented abstract data types from scratch. Those data types include:
  * trees,  
  * tables,
  * priority queues,
  * graphs
  in C++
