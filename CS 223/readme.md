# What is this course?
This is an introductory course in digital design, covering combinational and sequential circuits, memory and logic arrays and introduction to processor architecture.
The course uses SystemVerilog hardware description language throughout the semester to model and implement digital designs.


# What I have learned in this course?

* Fundamental blocks of digital design such as:
  - logic gates, 
  - flip-flops and latches, 
  - registers,
  - busses,
  - multiplexers,
  - ALU, 
  and so on..
* Karnaugh maps for simplifying logical circuits
* Implementing digital designs to an FPGA (Basys3) using HDL SystemVerilog
